<h2>Overview</h2>

The Net museum is an app which allows you to browse artworks from the <a href="https://metmuseum.github.io/">Met Museum API</a> in your terminal.
You can search by artist and artwork to find new pieces - and keep track of your favorite artists and artworks. 

The app will also randomly suggest search terms to you every time to aid you in your search 

Still stuck? With almost 1,000 artists in the Net museum - you may not know where to get started.(Be honest, have you <i>ever</i> heard of Hans Holbein the Younger?)

 Use the search suggestion feature or visit the "Overwhelmed?" section for a little direction. 

Just want to skip the search and see some art? Cool! Visit what's on view and the Net will randomly select a work to show you.

While you're here, update your bio and let everyone know a bit about you.
